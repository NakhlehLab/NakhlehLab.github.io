                        # Introduction

PhyloNet is a tool designed mainly for analyzing, reconstructing, and evaluating 
reticulate (or non-treelike) evolutionary relationships, generally known as phylogenetic 
networks. Various methods that we have developed make use of techniques and tools from 
the domain of phylogenetic trees, and hence the PhyloNet package includes several 
tools for phylogenetic tree analysis. PhyloNet is released under the GNU General 
Public License. For the full license, see the file GPL.txt included with this distribution.
  

#### Contributors
                        
PhyloNet is designed, implemented, and maintained by Rice's BioInformatics Group, 
which is lead by Professor Luay Nakhleh (nakhleh@cs.rice.edu). 

## Installation

#### System Requirements

In order to run the PhyloNet toolkit, you must have Java 1.7.0 or later installed on your system. 
All references to the java command assume that Java 1.7 is being used.

* To check your Java version, type "java -version" on your command line. 
* To download Java 1.7, please go to website http://www.java.com/en/download/.
* To link to the new downloaded Java 1.7, for mac, try these two commands from command line: 
  * ```sudo rm /usr/bin/java```
  * ```sudo ln -s /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/bin```

#### Downloading phylonet.jar

Acquire the current release of PhyloNet by downloading the most recent version of 
the PhyloNet JAR file. You will have a file named PhyloNet_X.Y.Z.jar, where X is the 
major version number and Y and Z are the minor version numbers.

<a href="/media/PhyloNet.jar" download="PhyloNet_3.8.2.jar"> Download v3.8.2 </a>

#### Installing the file

Place the jar file in the desired installation directory. The remainder of this 
document assumes that it is located in the $PHYLONET_PATH folder. Installation is now complete. 
In order to run PhyloNet, you must execute the file PhyloNet_X.Y.Z.jar, as described 
in the next section.

## Basic Usage

The PhyloNet tool is executed by typing the following command into your console:
``` >java -jar $PHYLONET_PATH/PhyloNet_X.Y.Z.jar script.nex ```

Where script.nex is the NEXUS file containing the commands to be executed.

## Basic NEXUS Overview

When PhyloNet is invoked with a specified NEXUS script file the tool will execute 
all of the commands contained within the file's PHYLONET block. 
For example, consider the following NEXUS file:

```
#NEXUS
        
BEGIN NETWORKS;
        
Network net = ((a,(b,(c)x#1)),((x#1,d),e));
Network net1 = ((a,(b,(c)x#1)),((d,x#1),e));
Network net2 = ((((a, (c)x#1), d), (b, x)), e);
Network net3 = ((a,b),(c,(d,(e,(f,g)))));
Network net4 = ((f,b),(c,(d,(a,(e,g)))));
        
END;
        
        
BEGIN PHYLONET;
        
Charnet net -m tree;
Cmpnets net1 net2 -m cluster;
CountCoal net3 net4;
        
END;
```

Blocks in a NEXUS file start with the BEGIN keyword and terminate with the END; keyword.
This example file contains two blocks--NETWORKS and PHYLONET. Contained within 
the PHYLONET block is the list of commands PhyloNet will execute when processing 
the NEXUS file. Commands in a PHYLONET block begin with a command identifier and 
terminate with a semicolon. In this example script, three commands are listed: 
Charnet, Cmpnets, and CountCoal. Appearing after the command identifier 
but before the semicolon are any parameters provided to a given command 
for its execution. For example in the script file above three parameters 
are provided to the Charnet command: net, -m and tree. Details about specific 
parameters for a given command can be found on the [documentation page for the given command](/html/phylonetCommands.html).
  

The NETWORKS block provides an area for defining any phylogenetic networks utilized by any 
command in the PHYLONET block. A network definition in the NETWORKS block must be of the form:
  
```Network "identifier" = "rich newick string";```

Where "identifier" is a user specified name for the network and "rich newick string" is a user specified Rich Newick string. 
For more information about Rich Newick strings view [this pdf](/media/pdfs/RichNewick.pdf) for a tutorial on how to use them.
  

In addition to the NETWORKS block, the TREES block may also be used to define Rich Newick strings.
However, Rich Newick strings defined in a TREES block may not contain hybridization nodes. 
Support for the TREES block as an alternate declaration to the NETWORKS block is for increased 
compatibility with NEXUS processing tools besides PhyloNet that historically consume 
or produce TREES blocks within NEXUS files.
  

For example usage of a TREES block consider the following NEXUS file:

```
#NEXUS
        
BEGIN TREES;
        
Tree speceiesTree = ((((a,b),c),d),e);
Tree geneTree1 = ((((a,b),c),d),e);
Tree geneTree2 = ((a,b),((c,e),d));
Tree geneTree3 = ((a,c),((b,e),d));
        
END;
        
        
BEGIN PHYLONET;
        
DeepCoalCount {speceiesTree} {geneTree1, geneTree2, geneTree3};
        
END;
```

The example script's TREES block defines four phylogenetic trees in Rich Newick form 
that are referenced by the DeepCoalCount command within the PHYLONET block.

## Managing Output

The default behavior of PhyloNet for reporting results is to display each command's 
output on the console. For example given the following NEXUS file charnet.nex:

```
#NEXUS
        
BEGIN NETWORKS;
        
Network net = ((a,(b,(c)x#1)),((x#1,d),e));
        
END;
        
        
BEGIN PHYLONET;
        
Charnet net -m tree;
        
END;
```

We could execute the script by typing the following command on the console:

```>java -jar $PHYLONET_PATH/jar/PhyloNet_X.Y.Z.jar charnet.nex```
  
which in turn would append the following output to the console:
```
>java -jar $PHYLONET_PATH/jar/PhyloNet_X.Y.Z.jar charnet.nex
        
Charnet net -m tree
((a,(b,c)),(e,d));
((a,b),((d,c),e));
        
>
```
  
Note how the Charnet command identifier and its parameters are first displayed 
followed by the output of the command. This feature becomes very helpful for 
reading results when many commands are listed in a single NEXUS file.

Most commands, including Charnet, support an optional final parameter that 
specifies the name of a file where command output should be redirected to instead 
of the console. For example, we could modify charnet.nex to send the command's 
output to the file C:\temp\charnet_output.txt as follows:

```
#NEXUS
        
BEGIN NETWORKS;
        
Network net = ((a,(b,(c)x#1)),((x#1,d),e));
        
END;
        
        
BEGIN PHYLONET;
        
Charnet net -m tree "C:\temp\charnet_output.txt";
        
END;
```

Upon executing the modified script from the console we would now see a new result 
without any tree results displayed to the console:

```
>java -jar $PHYLONET_PATH/jar/PhyloNet_X.Y.Z.jar charnet.nex
        
Charnet net -m tree "C:\temp\charnet_output.txt"
Writing output to C:\temp\charnet_output.txt
        
>
```
  
Opening the file C:\temp\charnet_output.txt would reveal the command output:

```
((a,(b,c)),(e,d));
((a,b),((d,c),e));
```

Each command that supports the optional file output parameter in a given NEXUS 
file can be given its own unique file parameter value resulting in the generation 
of distinct output files for each command. Alternatively, one may specify the 
file output parameter for only some commands in a NEXUS file. In this case those 
commands without the optional parameter would continue to utilize the default 
behavior and display their results on the console. Repeating a file output parameter 
value for many commands in a NEXUS file is not advisable as each command's output 
will overwrite the previous command's output with the same parameter value. 
One can however send the entire output of a PhyloNet execution to one file by 
using most operating systems' redirection operators.

#### Nexus_Out Command

PhyloNet provides a special command called Nexus_Out that instructs PhyloNet to 
additionally create an output NEXUS file containing a copy of each tree result 
generated by all commands within the script. For example, executing the following NEXUS script:

```
#NEXUS
        
BEGIN NETWORKS;
        
Network net = ((a,(b,(c)x#1)),((x#1,d),e));
        
END;
        
        
BEGIN PHYLONET;
        
Nexus_Out "C:\temp\nexus_out.nex";
Charnet net -m tree;
        
END;
```

would cause a file C:\temp\nexus_out.nex to be generated with contents:

```
#NEXUS
        
BEGIN TREES;
        
2_Charnet_1 = ((a,(b,c)),(e,d));
        
2_Charnet_2 = ((a,b),((d,c),e));
        
END;
``` 

in addition to the usual console output for the Charnet command.
  

All trees recorded in the TREES section will be of the form:
``` N_Command_M = ...; ```

Where N is the number of the command (that is, the nth command) as it appears in the original NEXUS script, 
Command is the command identifier of the command that generated the tree, and 
M denotes the mth tree generated by the nth command.
